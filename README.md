# CAIRS
For Coding Competition


first understand and use some small api for speech to text like vosk if u are using a raspberry pi , which we did
then use a LLM from huggingface , a transforer model that that can convert the text to command for the robot. after that buy a rc kit car that is comaptible to the raspberry pi called the picarx
after that build the picarx and then try your best to set up or to connect the cde to the picarx s that it can work
after that try to install a pre trained VLM model and try to give it some immages of yourself so that the video module of the picarx can recognizze your face and it would be easier to understand the person it is goign to then take any box make 2 hoels and take a strign and connect it to the picar x to put the item in the box and transport it
